* With :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above,
  the :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET` setting gained an option
  to specify the ``VCTargetsPath`` value for project files.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_VS_GLOBALS` variable value now applies during
  compiler identification and in targets created by the
  :command:`add_custom_target` command.
